BikesOnline Product and Sales Analysis 
This project is a freelance work associated wwith retail bike store in Australia. The project consists of 3 modules- 1. Data Quality Assessment, 2. Data Insights, 3. Data Insights & Presentations. 
The tasks involved analyzing the customer and transaction data of BikesOnline. The client provided a raw data with 4 large datasets: The first phase involved the task of data cleaning and preprocessing of the given datasets for further analysis. 
I have used Python for this purpose. The second phase required Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation to recommend which of the 1000 new customers from the new customers' list should be targeted to drive the most value for the organization. 
Here, I have conducted RFM Analysis for customer segmentation and created a PowerPoint presentation for the important information. The third and final module involved creating a Dashboard with data summary and results.
