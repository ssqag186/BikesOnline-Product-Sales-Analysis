This freelance project involved working with a retail bike store in Australia and comprised three key modules:

Data Quality Assessment
Data Insights
Data Insights & Presentations
The project centered around analyzing customer and transaction data for BikesOnline. The client provided four large datasets in raw form, which required cleaning and preprocessing as the initial phase. I utilized Python to perform these tasks, ensuring the data was ready for further analysis.

In the second phase, the focus shifted to Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation. The objective was to recommend which 1,000 new customers from a provided list should be targeted to generate the most value for the organization. To achieve this, I conducted an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis for customer segmentation and presented key findings through a PowerPoint presentation.

The third and final module involved developing a Dashboard to summarize the data and present the results.
